# SW Additional Suits MOD

### About
A pack of randomly made suits for Lethal Company using AlexCodesGames template.

Please show your appreciation for the original creator! My contribution was simply to introduce some new suits and tweak the existing ones. I'm sharing this just to simplify the integration into new modpacks for myself and my friends, making it a convenient one-click process.
