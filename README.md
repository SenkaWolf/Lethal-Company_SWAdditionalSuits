# SW Additional Suits Mod For Lethal Company

### About
A pack of randomly made suits for Lethal Company using AlexCodesGames template.

Please show your appreciation for the original creator! My contribution was simply to introduce some new suits and tweak the existing ones. I'm sharing this just to simplify the integration into new modpacks for myself and my friends, making it a convenient one-click process.

### ⁉️ FAQ
- Why have almost the exact same readme files in the root and 📂 `/SenkaWolfs-AdditionalSuits` directory?
	- The one in the root of the repository is for GitHub and the one in the 📂 `/SenkaWolfs-AdditionalSuits` directory is for the Tunderstore page.
- Why split the readme files up?
	- Having the github file overhead (.gitattributes, .git, LICENSE) seperated means I don't have to remove or mess around with files when releasing a new version to Tunderstore. Yes I'm lazy!
- Not all the suits in the pack work!
	- This happens when suit names clash and match on another pack. You will need to disable the conflicting suits pack.
